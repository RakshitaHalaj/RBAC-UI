# RBAC UI (Role-Based Access Control User Interface)

## Project Description

This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI built with **React**. It allows administrators to manage users, their roles, and access levels. The application provides functionalities to **Add**, **Edit**, and **Delete** users, as well as viewing their details, including name, email, role, and status.

The primary objective of this project is to implement an intuitive and interactive UI for managing users and their roles within a system. The UI interacts with mock API functions to simulate backend operations, and it uses React's hooks (such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom functions) for state management and rendering.

### Features:
- **Add User**: Admins can add new users with specific roles and status.
- **Edit User**: Admins can update the details of existing users.
- **Delete User**: Admins can delete users from the system.
- **View User List**: A table displays users along with their details and action buttons.

## My Role in the Project

I am responsible for the development and implementation of the **User Management System** as part of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI. My role includes:

- **Developing the User Interface**: Implementing the components like `UserList`, `UserForm`, and integrating them to provide a smooth UI experience for adding, editing, and deleting users.
- **State Management**: Using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage user data and the editing state in the application.
- **Integrating Mock API Functions**: Simulating backend operations for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using mock API functions.
- **Styling the Application**: Ensuring the UI is styled properly and is responsive, including customizing the form fields and buttons for a better user experience.
